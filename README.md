### WGAN Project for Whole Slide Image Generation in Digital Pathology

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with Wasserstein Loss and Gradient Penalty to generate realistic whole slide images (WSIs) in digital pathology. 

#### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **datasets/**: Contains the `preprocess_training_data.py` file, which handles the dataset preparation and augmentation.
- **models/**: Includes files defining the Generator (`generator.py`), Discriminator (`discriminator.py`), weight initialization (`initialize.py`), and gradient penalty computation (`gradient_penalty.py`).
- **utils/**: Consists of utility functions for visualization (`visualization.py`), checkpoint management (`checkpoint.py`), and training (`training.py`).
- **generate_images.py**: Script to generate images using the trained Generator model.
- **main.py**: Main script to train the DCGAN model.

#### Getting Started

##### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

##### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Annette29/whole_slide_image_generation_DCGAN-with-WL.git
   cd WGAN_Project
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

##### Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset:**

   Please find and download the kidney images dataset used from here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/k7nvtgn2x6/3
   Organize your training images in a directory, for example, `data/train`.

3. **Train the model:**

   Run the `main.py` script to start training the WGAN model:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Generate images:**

   Use the `generate_images.py` script to generate new images using the trained model:

   ```bash
   python generate_images.py --model_path path/to/checkpoint.pth.tar --num_images 10 --output_dir generated_images
   ```
